# Layer Migration

This is a work in progress. The automatic import functionality on Stream's side is done. We're working to make it easier to get your data out of Layer. Which is kinda cumbersome as the Layer API client doesn't support exports.

## Step 1 - The export

As a first step you'll want to lookup your APP id and the Server API token from your Layer Dashboard.



## Step 2 - Import to Stream

Simply email support@getstream.io with your data export.
It typically takes us 1 business day to import the data.
(if it's a small import it will take less time).

## Step 3 - Review the example

The stream support team will send you a fully functional react based chat interface that you can use to verify the data is imported correctly.


## Step 4 - Webhooks (optional)

You can start syncing writes from Stream to Layer via the webhook.
We're working on a serverless example that helps with this atm.

## Step 5 - Migrate the UI

Implement the UI that you want for your chat, and flip the switch
